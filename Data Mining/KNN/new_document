England manager Roy Hodgson has played down West Ham striker Andy Carroll's chance of being selected for Euro 2016.

There have been calls for Carroll, 27, to make an international return after his recent hat-trick against Arsenal.

But Hodgson said: "Every time someone scores a goal and he's English it is 'why is he not playing for England?'

"I'm certainly not going to pick him on the basis that he scored a hat-trick so therefore has to be in the England team."

Ex-Newcastle and Liverpool forward Carroll has scored two goals in nine England appearances, but has not featured for the national side since October 2012.
